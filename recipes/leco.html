    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lečo is a traditional Slovak dish that’s warm, comforting, and bursting with flavor. It’s made primarily from bell peppers, tomatoes, and onions, which simmer together to create a rich and savory vegetable stew. The dish is often seasoned with paprika, giving it a subtle, smoky depth that complements the sweetness of the peppers and the acidity of the tomatoes.</p>
    <p>Lečo can be enjoyed on its own as a vegetarian dish, or it can be made heartier with the addition of smoked sausage and eggs, turning it into a filling meal. This simple yet satisfying recipe is perfect for a quick weeknight dinner and pairs beautifully with fresh bread or rice to soak up all the delicious flavors.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp oil (vegetable or olive oil)</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2-3 bell peppers (red, yellow, or green), sliced into strips</li>
        <li>4-5 medium tomatoes, chopped (or 1 can of diced tomatoes)</li>
        <li>1-2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika (sweet or smoked)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1-2 sausages (optional), sliced</li>
        <li>4 eggs (optional)</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley or chives for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and cook for about 5 minutes, until they turn soft and golden.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic and bell peppers to the pan. Cook for another 5-7 minutes, or until the peppers start to soften.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chopped tomatoes and paprika. Season with salt and pepper, then reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer for 15-20 minutes, until the vegetables are soft and well combined.</li>
        <li>If desired, add the sausage slices to the pan, stirring them into the vegetable mixture. Cook until the sausage is heated through.</li>
        <li>For a heartier dish, crack the eggs directly into the pan and stir gently to scramble them into the lečo mixture. Continue cooking until the eggs are fully set.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh parsley or chives and serve hot with crusty bread, rice, or potatoes.</li>
    </ol>
