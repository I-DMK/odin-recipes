    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs (900g) lamb shoulder or neck, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1 large head of cabbage, cut into wedges</li>
        <li>2-3 tsp whole black peppercorns</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2-3 cups water</li>

        <li>In a large pot, layer the lamb pieces at the bottom. Sprinkle with a portion of the salt and peppercorns.</li>
        <li>Add a layer of cabbage wedges on top of the lamb. Repeat the layering of lamb, salt, peppercorns, and cabbage until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of cabbage.</li>
